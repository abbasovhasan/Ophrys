### Project Overview
This application seems to implement a feedback management system, likely enabling users to submit, validate, and process feedback.

### Key Folders and Files:
- **Abstractions**: Contains abstract classes or interfaces that define the structure for the service layer or data access.
- **Concretes**: Implements concrete classes, likely related to business logic or services for handling feedback.
- **Context**: Likely houses the database context, configuring and managing data models and database connections.
- **Controllers**: Manages API endpoints for handling HTTP requests for feedback-related operations.
- **Dtos**: Defines Data Transfer Objects, helping to encapsulate data structures for request and response payloads.
- **Migrations**: Contains migration files to manage database schema changes over time.
- **Models**: Defines data models representing entities like feedback items, users, or any associated data structures.
- **Validations**: Holds validation logic, ensuring that input data adheres to expected formats before processing.
- **Program.cs**: The main entry point for the application.
- **appsettings.json / appsettings.Development.json**: Configuration files that manage settings for environment variables, database connections, and app-specific settings.

### Dependencies and Setup
Since there is a `.csproj` file (`Feedback_System.csproj`), the application requires the .NET Core SDK to build and run. Configuration files suggest connection to a database, so a database instance (e.g., SQL Server or SQLite) may also be needed.

### Sample README Outline
Based on this overview, hereâ€™s a draft README.md for the project:

# Feedback System

This project is a feedback management system built with ASP.NET Core, providing a framework for collecting, processing, and managing user feedback. The application includes API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and validating feedback submissions.

## Features

- **Feedback Submission**: Allows users to submit feedback through API endpoints.
- **Validation**: Ensures submitted feedback meets specified criteria before processing.
- **Database Integration**: Uses Entity Framework Core for data management and migrations.
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings are managed through `appsettings.json`.

## Project Structure

- **Abstractions**: Contains interfaces for service and repository layers.
- **Concretes**: Implements the services and repositories for feedback handling.
- **Context**: Database context configurations using Entity Framework Core.
- **Controllers**: API controllers for managing feedback requests and responses.
- **Dtos**: Data Transfer Objects for encapsulating API request and response data.
- **Migrations**: Database migrations to manage schema evolution.
- **Models**: Entity classes representing database tables.
- **Validations**: Validation logic for request data integrity.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - Version 5.0 or later recommended
- Database (SQL Server, SQLite, etc.) as per configuration in `appsettings.json`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Feedback_System
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   Ensure your database is configured in `appsettings.json`, then run:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access API Documentation** (if integrated):
   Navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/swagger` to view API documentation.

## Configuration

- **appsettings.json**: Contains configuration settings, including connection strings and application-specific settings.
- **appsettings.Development.json**: Development-specific configuration.
